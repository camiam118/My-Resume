    <h1>Cameron Ogden</h1>
    <h2>Web Developer</h2>
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>After years of customer service related work and as a photographer for a large company for 4 years, 
        my interests outside of photography have brought me to finding ways to live and work where I desire. I've recently
        earned my certification in Teaching English as a Second Language (TEFL/TESOL) and begun learning how to become a Developer
        to increase my value as a remote worker. I'm looking to find work as a developer in a company that values a self-motivated,
        product and client-oriented individual, who never stops learning.
